# AdminTools for Spigot/Paper 1.17
Hello! Welcome to the GitHub page for **AdminTools**. This is a plugin I've been working on especially for Minecraft server admins and moderators. Check out the list of features below!
|Command|Aliases|Description|Permission|
|---|---|---|---|
|/fly|N/A|Fly in survival!|admintools.fly|
|/vanish|/v|Become invisible!|admintools.vanish|
|/die|/k|Kills a target|admintools.die|
|/invincible|/nodmg|Makes you invincible!|admintools.invincible|
|/heal|N/A|Heals you!|admintools.heal|
|/feed|N/A|Feeds you!|admintools.feed|
|/nick|N/A|Changes your name in chat!|admintools.nick|
|/gmode|/gm|Changes your gamemode!|admintools.gmode|
|/compasstarget|/ct|Sets the compass target!|admintools.compasstarget|
|/setspawn|/sp|Sets your spawn point!|admintools.setspawn|
|   |   |   |   |

This list may not be fully up to date! For a complete list, run the plugin and do `/help Admintools`.

All* commands in the above table support an IGN argument. For example, `/fly MrLukey676` would put player MrLukey676 into fly while `/fly` on its own would put you into fly. 
*This is except for `/nick` and `/compasstarget`. To use this, you specify the name you would like to use as your nick. For example, `/nick Dream` would change my nickname to Dream and `/nick` would reset it.

*This plugin has been developed in the UK by MrLukey676*
